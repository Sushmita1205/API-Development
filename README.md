# Api Development


This is my code for API development using Flask.

It is a simple web API with different HTTP methods like GET,POST,PUT,DELETE.

The data to be read by this API is a dummy data stored in a dictionary that contains information like author,language and title of different books.

GET,POST,PUT,DELETE methods can retrieve, add, update and delete records(books) respectively from the dummy data.
