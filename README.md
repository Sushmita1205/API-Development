# Api Development


This is my code for api development using flask.
It is a simple web api with GET,POST,PUT,DELETE methods.
The data to be read by this api is a dummy data stored in a dictionary that contains information like author,language and title of different books.
GET,POST,PUT,DELETE methods can retrieve, add, update and delete records(books) respectively from the dummy data.
